Generated Summary:
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.
It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data,
identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
The iterative aspect of machine learning is important because as models are exposed to new data, 
they are able to independently adapt. They learn from previous computations to produce reliable, 
repeatable decisions and results.
